	Standard brick breaker game. 
	Keep it super simple.
	LOTS OF JUICE!!!
	
	Set amount of hand built levels.
	Get high score at end of game. 

	Different bricks have different effects.
		-Bounce ball in random direction.
		-Ball breaks brick and passes straight through (like glass).
		-Ball gets caught by brick and launched straight up/down/left/right. 
		-Balls speeds up/slows down. 

	Get powerups randomly from bricks. 
	Powerup drop chance depends on level or brick or both. 
		-Extra life.
		-Guns.
		-Longer paddle.
		-Slower ball.
		-Split ball.
		-Sticky paddle.
		-Other, new ideas. 

	Don't use physics for bouncing, just for collision detection. 
		Use _rb.MovePosition() in FixedUpdate so collisions still work. 
		Calculate ball's bounce angle in code. 
			Sharper angles the further the ball hits from the center of the paddle. 
			Brick angles will be pretty straightforward, but with a little randomness (except for special bricks). 
		Have ball handle bounce logic, not brick/paddle.
